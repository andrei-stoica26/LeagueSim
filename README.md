The program generates match scores based on expected goals per match figures (scored & conceded) computed for each team based on Premier League 2022-23 data and adjusted by a random factor. 

In each round, the number of goals scored by a team depends on the mean of its expected scored goals per match and the expected conceded goals per match of the opposing team. 

After each round, new league tables are saved, and the strenghts of the teams (expected scored & conceded goals per match) receive a small random adjustment.
